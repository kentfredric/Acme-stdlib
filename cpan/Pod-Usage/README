Pod::Usage
----------
The Perl5 module "Pod::Usage" which provides the function "pod2usage()"
to print usage messages for a Perl script based on its embedded pod
documentation. Pod::Usage is a subclass of Pod::PlainText. Please see
the POD documentation for this module (embedded in the file "Usage.pm")
for more details. The pod2usage() function is probably the most
generally useful function in this entire distribution since it is
useful to just about any Perl5 script that is invoked from the
command-line.

See the POD documentation for more details.

This separate distribution was created to allow refactoring of Pod::Usage
to use Pod::Simple instead of Pod::Parser, such that Pod::Parser can be
discontinued from the Perl Core in the near future.
